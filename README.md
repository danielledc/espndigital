As an interactive developer consultant at ESPN, I currently lead HTML5 development of interactive digital banners
promoting ESPN programming and sporting events appearing across ESPN networks.

These banners use the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) TweenMax library for animation 
effects: http://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/GSAP/TweenMax/.

In addition, many banners use the Javascript date object and methods to change the tune in messaging based on the client date/time.
