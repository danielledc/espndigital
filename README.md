As a Creative Works Developer at ESPN from 2015-2018, I lead HTML5 development of interactive digital banners promoting ESPN programming and sporting events appearing across ESPN networks.

These banners used the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) TweenMax library for animation 
effects: http://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/GSAP/TweenMax/.

In addition, many banners use the Javascript Date object and methods to change the tune in messaging based on the client date/time. The tune in data is either coded directly in the banners, or is read from a JSON file.
